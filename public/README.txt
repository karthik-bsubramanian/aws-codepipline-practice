CodePipeline Practice App
========================

This is a fancy Node.js app designed for AWS CodePipeline and Elastic Beanstalk practice.

How to practice CI/CD:
1. Edit the message in the `/api/message` endpoint in `server.js` (look for the `message` field).
2. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
3. Watch your deployed app update automatically via CodePipeline and Elastic Beanstalk!

You can also change styles or text in `public/index.html` to see frontend changes reflected after deployment.
